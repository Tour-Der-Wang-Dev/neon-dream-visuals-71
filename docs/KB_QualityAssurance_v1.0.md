# Knowledge Base Quality Assurance Procedures

**Last Updated:** 2025-06-07  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Owner:** AI Image Generator Team  
**Status:** Active

## Quick Reference
- Comprehensive QA procedures for knowledge base maintenance
- Regular review cycles and quality metrics
- Automated and manual validation processes
- Issue tracking and resolution workflows

## Quality Assurance Framework

### Quality Metrics

#### Content Quality Indicators
- **Accuracy Rate**: >95% of technical information verified
- **Completeness Score**: >90% of required sections present
- **Freshness Index**: >80% of content updated within last 6 months
- **Link Integrity**: >98% of links functional
- **Format Compliance**: 100% YAML frontmatter valid

#### User Experience Metrics
- **Findability**: Average time to locate information <2 minutes
- **Readability**: Grade level appropriate for target audience
- **Navigation**: Clear structure with <3 clicks to any content
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance

### Review Cycles

#### Daily Automated Checks
- Link validation across all documentation
- YAML frontmatter validation
- Markdown syntax checking
- Spell checking and grammar validation
- File naming convention compliance

#### Weekly Reviews
- Recent modifications quality check
- New content validation
- Cross-reference integrity
- Tag consistency verification
- Image and media validation

#### Monthly Audits
- High-traffic documentation review
- User feedback incorporation
- Outdated content identification
- Performance metric analysis
- Search optimization review

#### Quarterly Comprehensive Reviews
- Complete knowledge base audit
- Content gap analysis
- Structure optimization assessment
- Migration planning for deprecated content
- Annual planning and roadmap updates

## Validation Procedures

### Content Validation Checklist

#### Pre-Publication Review
- [ ] YAML frontmatter complete and accurate
- [ ] Content follows style guide standards
- [ ] Technical accuracy verified by SME
- [ ] Code examples tested and functional
- [ ] Links verified and accessible
- [ ] Cross-references updated
- [ ] Screenshots and diagrams current
- [ ] Grammar and spelling checked

#### Technical Validation
- [ ] API endpoints tested and documented
- [ ] Code samples execute without errors
- [ ] Dependencies versions verified
- [ ] Configuration examples validated
- [ ] Security guidelines followed
- [ ] Performance considerations documented

#### Accessibility Validation
- [ ] Proper heading hierarchy used
- [ ] Alt text provided for images
- [ ] Color contrast sufficient
- [ ] Content readable without formatting
- [ ] Navigation keyboard accessible
- [ ] Screen reader compatible

### Automated Quality Checks

#### CI/CD Integration
```yaml
# Quality check workflow triggers
on:
  pull_request:
    paths: ['docs/**/*.md']
  push:
    branches: [main]
    paths: ['docs/**/*.md']
```

#### Validation Scripts
```bash
# Run comprehensive quality checks
./scripts/kb-maintenance.sh validate

# Check specific quality metrics
./scripts/kb-quality-check.sh --links --yaml --spelling
```

## Issue Management

### Issue Categories

#### High Priority Issues
- Broken external links in critical documentation
- Security vulnerabilities in code examples
- Incorrect technical specifications
- Missing required documentation
- Accessibility violations

#### Medium Priority Issues
- Outdated content (>6 months old)
- Inconsistent formatting
- Missing cross-references
- Incomplete code examples
- Performance issues in large documents

#### Low Priority Issues
- Minor grammatical errors
- Styling inconsistencies
- Non-critical broken internal links
- Optimization opportunities
- Enhancement suggestions

### Resolution Workflow

#### Issue Detection
1. **Automated Detection**: CI/CD pipeline failures
2. **User Reports**: Feedback forms and support tickets
3. **Regular Audits**: Scheduled review processes
4. **Community Contributions**: External contributor reports

#### Issue Triage
1. **Categorization**: Assign priority and type labels
2. **Assignment**: Route to appropriate team member
3. **Timeline**: Set resolution deadline based on priority
4. **Tracking**: Add to project management system

#### Resolution Process
1. **Investigation**: Analyze root cause and impact
2. **Planning**: Develop resolution strategy
3. **Implementation**: Execute fixes with peer review
4. **Validation**: Test and verify resolution
5. **Documentation**: Update changelog and close issue
